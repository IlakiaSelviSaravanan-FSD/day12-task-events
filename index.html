                <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted <b>programming</b> language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
<br>
Why to Learn Javascript?<br>
Javascript is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Javascript:
<ul>
  <li>Javascript is the most popular <b>programming language</b> in the world and that makes it a programmerâ€™s great choice. Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different Javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc</li>
  <li>Javascript is everywhere, it comes installed on every modern web browser and so to learn Javascript you really do not need any special environment setup. For example Chrome, Mozilla Firefox , Safari and every browser you know as of today, supports Javascript.</li>
  <li>Javascript helps you create really beautiful and crazy fast websites. You can develop your website with a console like look and feel and give your users the best Graphical User Experience.</li>
  <li>JavaScript usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development. This opens many opportunities for you as Javascript Programmer.</li>
  <li>Due to high demand, there is tons of job growth and high pay for those who know JavaScript. You can navigate over to different job sites to see what having JavaScript skills looks like in the job market.</li>
  <li>Great thing about Javascript is that you will find tons of frameworks and Libraries already developed which can be used directly in your software development to reduce your time to market.</li>
  
</ul>

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-profile" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-profile-tab">
              <p>JavaScript is a dynamic 
              computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with 
              the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

              JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScrip
              t made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
              
              The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-messages" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-messages-tab">Client-Side JavaScript
              Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
              
              It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
              
              The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.
              
              The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.</div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-settings" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-settings-tab">The script tag takes two important attributes 

              Language This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using. Typically, its value will be javascript. Although recent versions of HTML (and XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.
              
              Type.This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascript".</div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-Enabling" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="v-pills-Enabling-tab">
                Let us take a sample example to print out "Hello World". We added an optional HTML comment that surrounds our JavaScript code. This is to save our code from a browser that does not support JavaScript. The comment ends with a "//-->". Here "//" signifies a comment in JavaScript, so we add that to prevent a browser from reading the end of the HTML comment as a piece of JavaScript code. Next, we call a function document.write which writes a string into our HTML document.

                This function can be used to write text, HTML, or both. Take a look at the following code.</div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-Placement" role="tabpanel" ria-labelledby="v-pills-Placement-tab">JavaScript in External File
                As you begin to work more extensively with JavaScript, you will be likely to find that there are cases where you are reusing identical JavaScript code on multiple pages of a site.
                
                You are not restricted to be maintaining identical code in multiple HTML files. The script tag provides a mechanism to allow you to store JavaScript in an external file and then include it into your HTML files.
                
                Here is an example to show how you can include an external JavaScript file in your HTML code using script tag and its src attribute.

              </div>
              <div class="tab-pane fade" id="v-pills-Variables" role="tabpanel" ria-labelledby="v-pills-Variables-tab">
                JavaScript Datatypes
One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.

JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types âˆ’

Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.

Strings of text e.g. "This text string" etc.

Boolean e.g. true or false.
